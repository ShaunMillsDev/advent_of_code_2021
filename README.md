# Advent of Code 2021 Challenges

Repo for my Advent of Code 2021 challenges.

### Day 1 - Sonar Sweep (https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1):
**Part 1:**   
Count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.

**Part 2:**   
Given two people's calendars, daily bounds, and a meeting duration, return free slots of time during which these two people could have a meeting. The daily bounds specify the time they start their day and the time they end their day. They are not available outside these bounds.

### Day 2 - Dive! (https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2):
**Part 1:**   
Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?

**Part 2:**   
Continuation from part 1, instructions alter values in a different way.
